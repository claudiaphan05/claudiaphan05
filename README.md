## Hi there 👋
My name is Claudia and I am a current junior at Texas A&M University. I am interested in learning more about embedded systems and am currently working on creating games. I enjoy ripping Pokemon card packs and researching keyboards in my free time and am excited to see what projects come up in the future.
